Using the ownCloud Android App
==============================

Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and 
convenient, as you can use any Web browser on any operating system without 
installing special client software. However, the ownCloud Android app offers 
some advantages over the Web interface:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on a tablet or smartphone
* Automatic synchronization of your files
* Share files with other ownCloud users and groups, and create public share 
  links
* Instant uploads of photos or videos recorded on your Android device
* Easily add files from your device to ownCloud
* Two-factor authentication

New In Version 1.9.1
--------------------

This release contains a number of improvements, including:

* Set and edit permissions on internal shared data.
* Instant uploads: avoid file duplications, set policy in app settings.
* Control duplication of files uploaded via **Upload** button.
* Select view mode: either list or grid per folder.
* More buttons and checkboxes for faster operations.
* Fixed battery drain in automatic synchronization.
* Security fixes related to passcode.
* Wording fixes.

Upgrading
---------

When you download your ownCloud Android App from the Google Play store, it will 
be upgraded just like any other Play Store app, according to your settings on 
your Android device. It will either upgrade automatically, or give you a 
notification than an upgrade is available.

If you are using an ownCloud Android app from a custom repository, e.g. your 
employer, then you will upgrade according their policies.

Getting the ownCloud Android App
--------------------------------

One way to get your ownCloud Android app is to log into your ownCloud server 
from your Android device using a Web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or 
Dolphin. The first time you log in to a new ownCloud account you'll see a screen 
with a download link to the ownCloud app in the `Google Play store
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android>`_.

You will also find these links on your Personal page in the ownCloud Web interface.

Find source code and more information from the `ownCloud download page 
<http://owncloud.org/install/#mobile>`_.

Users of customized ownCloud Android apps, for example from their employer, 
should follow their employer's instructions.

Connecting to Your ownCloud Server
----------------------------------

The first time you run your ownCloud Android app it opens to a configuration 
screen. Enter your server URL, login name, password, and click the Connect 
button. (Click the eyeball to the right of your password to expose your 
password.)

For best security your ownCloud server should be SSL-enabled, so that you can 
connect via ``https``. The ownCloud app will test your connection as soon as 
you enter it and tell you if you entered it correctly. If your server has a 
self-signed SSL certificate you'll get a warning that it is not to be 
trusted. Click the OK button to accept the certificate and complete your account 
setup.

Managing Files
--------------

Now you should see the Files page of your ownCloud account.

The ownCloud menu at the top left shows the name of the logged-in user, has a 
shortcut to your files, and contains the Settings button.

   :alt: Top-left menu.

Click the overflow button at the top right (that's the one with three vertical 
dots) to open a user menu. **Grid view** toggles between grid and list 
view. **Refresh account** syncs with the server, and **Sort** 
gives you the option to sort your files by date, or alphabetically.

   :alt: Top-right menu.

The little file folder icon to the left of the overflow button opens a dialog to 
create a new folder. The arrow button opens a file upload dialog, and you can 
either upload content from other Android apps such as Google Drive, the Gallery, 
your music player, or from your Android filesystem.

All files (that you have permission to access) on your ownCloud server are 
displayed in your Android app, but are not downloaded until you click on them. 
Downloaded files are marked with a green arrow.

Download and view a file with a short press on the filename.  Then a short 
press on the overflow button opens a menu with options for managing your file.

    read on the Internet."
   
When you are on your main Files page, a long press on any file or folder 
displays a list of options: Share, Open With, Synchronize, Rename, Move, Copy, 
Remove, Send, Favorite, and Details.

Click Share to share files. You can share with other ownCloud users, and create 
public share links. If your ownCloud server administrator has enabled username 
auto-completion, when you start typing user or group names they will 
auto-complete. After you have shared files, click the Share button to see who 
you have shared with, and to remove shares.

Settings
--------

Use the Settings screen to control your ownCloud app functions.

   :alt: Setting screen.

In the Accounts section you can set up and manage multiple accounts.

The Security section sets up strong two-factor authentication by allowing you 
to add a PIN (personal identification number) to access your account.  

The Instant Uploads section creates a directory, :file:`/InstantUpload`, and any 
photos or videos created with your Android device's camera are instantly 
uploaded to this directory. You also have the option to choose any other 
existing directory, or to create a new one. Another nice option is Upload 
Pictures/Video via WiFi Only, to conserve your mobile data usage.

The bottom section of the Settings screen has links to Help, Recommend to a 
friend, Feedback, and the version number.

Removing/Logging Out
--------------------

On your Settings page, a long press on an account name opens a dialog to 
**Change password** or **Remove account**. **Change password** is, of course, 
changing your password.

**Remove account** logs you out of the server, removes your account settings, 
and removes your files from your Android device. It does not change anything on 
the server. There is no logout function that simply logs out of your account 
and leaves all your files on your Android device. If you want extra security, 
you can set a login PIN on your Android device, and also on your ownCloud 
account. If you are using a shared Android device, other users can access your 
files in the file manager if you are sharing a single user account, so you 
could set up multiple user accounts to protect your files.
